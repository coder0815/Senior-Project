Readme - Highlight Shaders
_________________________


The new version of the shaders include a script. When using the new highlight shaders you will need 
to add the MergeSmoothingGroup script to your object in order to work properly.

1. Add the highlight material to your model.
2. Add the "MergeSmoothingGroup" script to your model too.
